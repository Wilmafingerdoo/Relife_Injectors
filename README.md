Paste the config.cpp and stringtable.csv into the relife_Injectors folder and it will make it so that the names and descriptions are displayed in the 13 ingame languages. 

I have no idea how accurate the translations are i used "CSV Stringtable Creator 1.0.2" all i did was translated the original name and description for the items into english put them into the program and it does the translation to each language.
